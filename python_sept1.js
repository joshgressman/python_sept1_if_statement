Sept 2016 python syntax

if statements

if 5 > 3:
//do something

if 5 > 3:
print("number is greater than five")

now use a for loop with a if statement conditional

numbers = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]

for number in numbers:
if number > 5:
print(number)

This will print only numbers greater than five. If the statement is true,
the function will run, if FALSE the function will do nothing
